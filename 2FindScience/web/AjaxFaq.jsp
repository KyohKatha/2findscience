                            <div>
                                <p>There's a link on the top of the page, near the 'Home' tab.</p>

                            <div>
                                <p>Yes. Click in the 'Profile' tab in your menu.</p>
                            </div>
                            <h3><a href="#">How can I insert publications?</a></h3>
                            <div>
                                <p>Firstly you have to have an Academic Profile, which have a green banner.</p>
                                <p>If your profile is correct, you can check the 'Publications' tab on your menu.</p>
                            </div>
                            <h3><a href="#">How can I contact the administrator?</a></h3>
                            <div>
                                <p>You can fill the contact form. Just click on the 'Contact' tab on your menu. </p>
                            </div>
                            <h3><a href="#">My profile has an orange banner(Common Profile)! How can I acquire an Academic Profile?</a></h3>
                            <div>
                                <p>Click on the 'Profile' tab in your menu. Then, click on the 'Upgrade!' button, below your profile informations.</p>
                                <p>You should inform your password correctly so that your request can be 
                                    sent to the administrator correctly. Read the instructions on that page carefully.
                                </p>
                                <p>Tip: The profile upgrade depends on the administrator,
                                    so try to maintain your profile updated!
                                </p>
                            </div>
                            <h3><a href="#">Why do I have subjects?</a></h3>
                            <div>
                                <p>The subjects informed in your profile affect directly the content present on the
                                    'news' tab. That means that if you only have the subject 'Database' in your profile, you will only
                                    see the latest publications and events related to that subject.
                                </p>
                                <p>So whenever you insert a publication try to relate it to the subjects that best fits it!</p>
                            </div>
                            <h3><a href="#">What does the icons in the news column mean?</a></h3>
                            <div>
                                <p>The symbol with three people <img src="Imagens/sign_event.png" alt="eve"/>
                                    represents the insertion of a new event.</p>
                                <p>The icon with one person and a sheet <img src="Imagens/sign_pub.png" alt="pub"/>
                                    represents the insertion of a new publication.</p>
                            </div>
                            <h3><a href="#">What types of publication can I insert?</a></h3>
                            <div>

                            <h3><a href="#">What if I want to insert a new type of publication?</a></h3>
                            <div>
                                <p>At the moment that is not possible.</p>
                            </div>
                            <h3><a href="#">Can I insert a new event?</a></h3>
                            <div>
                                <p>That can only be achieved by the administrator of the website.
                                    But when you insert a new publication, you can inform in what events that publication
                                    was present.</p>
                            </div>
                            <h3><a href="#">Can I alter/delete an inserted publication?</a></h3>
                            <div>
                                <p>It depends. Only the user that inserted the publication can alter/delete it.
                                </p>
                                <p>IMPORTANT: The administrator can alter/delete any publication.</p>
